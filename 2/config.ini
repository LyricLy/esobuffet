task description = While folks at CG can't draw I have difficulty counting.
  Could you please give me a programming language that can do these assignments for me?
  I will give you points! You just have to read three integers A, B and C, and then
  A * B numbers representing an AxB matrix, and B * C numbers representing a BxC matrix,
  and output A * C numbers representing the AxC matrix resulting from multiplying the
  previous two. All matrices are given in row major order, and the output should be also.
  Make your submission hard, but not so hard that nobody solves it.
